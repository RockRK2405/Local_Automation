Local Cloud Automation Simulator 

This project simulates a basic cloud automation workflow entirely on a local machine using Python , Flask , and Shell/Bash Commands scripts.
It demonstrates the core idea of having a compute instance, running a task, fetching logs, and terminating the instance â€” similar to what you might 
do with a cloud provider like AWS EC2.

Further i Downloaded the Postman and integrated with the API to get and fetch all the logs in that GUI it was pretty good feels like a console to
manage my API instances.

In a summary I , 

:Started a simulated instance (`/start`)
:Run a bash script to generate output logs
:Fetch logs via API (`/output`)
:Simulate instance shutdown (`/stop`)
:Flask-based REST API for easy interaction (tested using Postman)
:Fully offline and platform independent (works on macOS/Linux)

Planning to extend this project into a real world automation framework for firms that combines hardware + cloud + AI.

:Integration with AWS using Boto3 to control real cloud infrastructure
:IoT Device Integration using Raspberry Pi or Arduino boards
:Real sensors like eg DHTs to send temperature or humidity data
:Use open-source models like DeepSeek or LLMs to trigger smart actions based on sensor data.
:Secure API interface using token based auth or API keys.
